# Treasure Island
This code is a simple text-based adventure game in which the player must navigate through a series of choices to find the treasure on an island. The player is presented with a series of prompts and must choose between two options by typing "left" or "right". The game has three different endings, depending on the choices the player makes.

# Getting Started
To run this code, you will need a Python interpreter. No additional dependencies are required.

# Usage
To play the game, run the code and follow the prompts. You will be presented with a series of choices and must type "left" or "right" to make your selection. The game has three possible endings: winning by finding the treasure, losing by choosing the wrong door, or losing by making a choice that leads to an impossible outcome.

# Known Issues
The code does not currently handle input validation, so entering anything other than "left" or "right" may cause the code to crash.

Future Development
* Implement input validation to handle invalid user input.
* Add additional choices and endings to the game.
* Implement a scoring system to keep track of multiple rounds of the game.
